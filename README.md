## **Key Features**

1. **API Integration**  
   - Utilizes the **Open-Meteo API** to fetch weather data, including:  
     - Maximum and minimum temperatures.  
     - Daily precipitation values.

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Extracts relevant weather data such as dates, temperatures, and precipitation from the API response.
   - Organizes data into a **Pandas DataFrame** for streamlined manipulation and analysis.

3. **Visualization**  
   - **Temperature Trends:**  
     - Line plots for maximum and minimum temperatures.  
     - A shaded region highlights the temperature range for each day.  
   - **Precipitation Trends:**  
     - Bar plots display daily precipitation levels for clarity.  

4. **User-Centric Features**  
   - Detailed and labeled plots with titles, axis descriptions, and legends.  
   - Gridlines enhance readability.  
   - Responsive resizing ensures visual clarity on different screen sizes.
